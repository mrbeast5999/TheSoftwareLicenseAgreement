whether on disk, in read only memory, on any other media or in any other form (collectively the “Bookmarks
Software”) are licensed, not sold, to you by Bookmarks Inc. (“Bookmarks”) for use only under the terms of this
License. Bookmarks and/or Bookmarks’s licensors retain ownership of the Bookmarks Software itself and reserve all rights
not expressly granted to you.
B. Bookmarks, at its discretion, may make available future upgrades or updates to the Bookmarks Software for your
compatible computer. Upgrades and updates, if any, may not necessarily include all existing software
features or new features that Bookmarks releases for newer or other models of computer. The terms of this
License will govern any software upgrades or updates provided by Bookmarks that replace and/or supplement
the original Bookmarks Software product, unless such upgrade or update is accompanied by a separate license
in which case the terms of that license will govern.
C. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the Bookmarks
Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other
intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing
such content. This License does not grant you any rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that
such content will continue to be available to you.
2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
A. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License:
(i) Unless you obtained the Bookmarks Software as described in Section 2A(ii) below, you are granted a
limited, non-exclusive license to download, install and use one (1) copy of the Bookmarks Software on each
compatible computer you own or control;
(ii) If you obtained the Bookmarks Software from the Microsoft Store, you are granted a limited, nontransferable, non-exclusive license to download, install, and use one (1) copy of the Bookmarks Software on
each compatible computer that is affiliated with the Microsoft account that you use to access the Microsoft
Store.
B. Other Use Restrictions. To the extent that the Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials,
such use is limited to reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the
copyright, or materials you are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. You may not make the Bookmarks
Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time. You
may make one copy of the Bookmarks Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided
that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. In
addition to the restrictions stated above, the Bookmarks proprietary libraries (“Bookmarks DLLs”) included with the
Bookmarks Software are only licensed for use with the Bookmarks Software, except that if you are a WebKit
developer, you may use the Bookmarks DLLs for your personal use or internal business use in connection with
your development of WebKit in accordance with the relevant WebKit licenses <https://webkit.org/>.
C. No Reverse Engineering. You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as
expressly permitted by this License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the
source code of, decrypt, modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided
by the Bookmarks Software or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is
prohibited by applicable law or by licensing terms governing use of Open-Sourced Components that may
be included with the Bookmarks Software).
D. VoiceOver Kit - Automatic Updates. When you are using VoiceOver Kit, the Bookmarks Software will
periodically check with Bookmarks for updates to the pronunciation rules used by VoiceOver to generate the
spoken items that you hear when you have VoiceOver selected. If a pronunciation update is available, the
update will automatically download onto your computer, and when you have VoiceOver selected, the new
version of the spoken items will be generated and synced to your iPod. The older version of the spoken
items will no longer be available. These automatic updates will not change the actual media content (e.g.,
music, video, podcasts) on your iPod or in your iTunes library.
E. Open Source. Certain components of the Bookmarks Software, and third party open source programs
included with the Bookmarks Software, have been or may be made available by Bookmarks on its Open Source web
site (https://www.opensource.Bookmarks.com/) (collectively the “Open-Sourced Components”). You may modify
or replace only these Open-Sourced Components; provided that: (i) the resultant modified Bookmarks Software
is used, in place of the unmodified Bookmarks Software, on a single computer; and (ii) you otherwise comply
with the terms of this License and any applicable licensing terms governing use of the Open-Sourced
Components. Bookmarks is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the
resultant modified Bookmarks Software.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, redistribute or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. Bookmarks Software
obtained from the Microsoft Store is not transferable. If you sell your computer to a third party, you must
remove the Bookmarks Software from your computer before doing so. For Bookmarks Software you obtained directly
from Bookmarks (e.g., downloaded from https://www.Bookmarks.com/itunes/download/), you may, however, make a
one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to another party, provided
that: (a) the transfer must include all of the Bookmarks Software, including all its component parts and this
License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a
computer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the Bookmarks Software reads and agrees to
accept the terms and conditions of this License

and related information, including but not limited to unique system or hardware identifiers, information
about your computer, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to
provide and improve Bookmarks’s products and services, facilitate the provision of software updates, product
support and other services to you (if any) related to the Bookmarks Software, and to verify compliance with the
terms of this License. Bookmarks may use this information, as long as it is collected in a form that does not
personally identify you, for the purposes described above.

available in all languages or in all countries. Use of the Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms of service and may
be subject to additional fees.
B. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, iTunes Store account or iCloud account, you
agree to the applicable terms and conditions for that account, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services

accuracy.
D. Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any other
materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites are
provided solely as a convenience to you. You agree that you will not use any Third Party Materials in a
manner that would infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any way
responsible for any such use by you.
E. To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you own
all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and that such
content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the Services,
including but not limited to graphics, audio clips, and editorial content, contain proprietary content,
information and material that is owned by Bookmarks and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable
intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use
such proprietary content, information or materials other than for permitted use of the Services or in any
manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property rights
of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You
agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in
any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not
limited to, using the Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or
by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to
harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and
that Bookmarks is not in any way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening,
defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of
using any of the Services.
F. In addition, Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on or linked to
from the Bookmarks Software are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no
representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any
particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such Services and Third Party Materials,
you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but
not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and data collection laws. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve
the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no
event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also
impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited non-exclusive license to

used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.

copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any
rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.
(f) Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may: (i) use the Memoji characters included in
or created with the Bookmarks Software (“System Characters”) (1) while running the Bookmarks Software and (2) to
create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No
other use of the System Characters or Live Captions is permitted by this License, including but not
limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.
(g) In order to complete certain app and/or website action shortcuts, the Bookmarks Software may need to
access certain third party software applications, services or websites on your Device. You expressly
consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for
some features of the Bookmarks Software and Services.
(i) Use of the App Store requires a unique user name and password combination, known as an Bookmarks ID.
An Bookmarks ID is also required to access app updates and certain features of the Bookmarks Software and
Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to
another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your Device, provided that: (a) the transfer

License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

5. Services and Third Party Materials.
(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared
Albums” and “Find My” may be accessed directly from the Bookmarks Software. You acknowledge and agree
that your use of iCloud and these features is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the iCloud
service, which you may access and review at: https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/.
(c) News App Content. Your use of content accessed through the News application is limited solely to
personal, noncommercial use, does not transfer any ownership interest to you in the content, and
specifically excludes, without limitation, any commercial or promotional use rights in such content.

may vary by region. When you turn on or use Maps, details will be provided regarding what information
is sent to Bookmarks and how the information may be used. You acknowledge and agree that your use of
Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Bookmarks
Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.

view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will

disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for

of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

5. Services and Third Party Materials.
(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared
Albums” and “Find My” may be accessed directly from the Bookmarks Software. You acknowledge and agree
that your use of iCloud and these features is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the iCloud
service, which you may access and review at: https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/.

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By

the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and

(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should

information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,

posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and

their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not

sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit

Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all

such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or

License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit

such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable
law or by licensing terms governing use of open-source components that may be included with the
Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.

reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you
are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from
republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for

install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.

provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

make the Bookmarks Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple Devices at the
same time. This License does not grant you any rights to use Bookmarks proprietary interfaces and other

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable
law or by licensing terms governing use of open-source components that may be included with the
Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.
(e) The Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials so long as such use is limited to
reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you
are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from
republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any
rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.

or created with the Bookmarks Software (“System Characters”) (1) while running the Bookmarks Software and (2) to
create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

access certain third party software applications, services or websites on your Device. You expressly
consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for

An Bookmarks ID is also required to access app updates and certain features of the Bookmarks Software and
Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to
another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your Device, provided that: (a) the transfer
must include your Device and all of the Bookmarks Software, including all its component parts and this
License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

5. Services and Third Party Materials.
(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Bookmarks
Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE WILL BE

OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Bookmarks OR AN Bookmarks
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL Bookmarks, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR PRINCIPALS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA,

Bookmarks HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no
event shall Bookmarks’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law
in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars (U.S.$250.00). The
foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

certificates either issued from Bookmarks or from third parties. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR
DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY ON A CERTIFICATE WHETHER ISSUED BY Bookmarks OR A
THIRD PARTY. YOUR USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Bookmarks MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL CERTIFICATES.
10. Export Control. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Bookmarks Software except as
authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which the Bookmarks Software was

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable

Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.

republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any

create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be

An Bookmarks ID is also required to access app updates and certain features of the Bookmarks Software and
Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

SERVICES. INSTALLATION OF THIS Bookmarks SOFTWARE MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY AND
USABILITY OF THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY SERVICES, AS WELL AS

OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE
OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Bookmarks OR AN Bookmarks
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL Bookmarks, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR PRINCIPALS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA,
FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION COURSE

Bookmarks HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no
event shall Bookmarks’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law
in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars (U.S.$250.00). The
foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY ON A CERTIFICATE WHETHER ISSUED BY Bookmarks OR A
THIRD PARTY. YOUR USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Bookmarks MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL CERTIFICATES.

features or new features that Bookmarks releases for newer or other models of computer. The terms of this
License will govern any software upgrades or updates provided by Bookmarks that replace and/or supplement
the original Bookmarks Software product, unless such upgrade or update is accompanied by a separate license
in which case the terms of that license will govern.
C. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the Bookmarks
Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other
intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing
such content. This License does not grant you any rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that
such content will continue to be available to you.
2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
A. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License:

limited, non-exclusive license to download, install and use one (1) copy of the Bookmarks Software on each
compatible computer you own or control;

each compatible computer that is affiliated with the Microsoft account that you use to access the Microsoft
Store.
B. Other Use Restrictions. To the extent that the Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials,
such use is limited to reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the
copyright, or materials you are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. You may not make the Bookmarks
Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time. You
may make one copy of the Bookmarks Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided

including but not limited to graphics, audio clips, and editorial content, contain proprietary content,
information and material that is owned by Bookmarks and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable
intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use
such proprietary content, information or materials other than for permitted use of the Services or in any
manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property rights

agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in
any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not

representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any
particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such Services and Third Party Materials,
you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but
not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and data collection laws. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve
the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no
event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also
impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No
other use of the System Characters or Live Captions is permitted by this License, including but not
limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.
(g) In order to complete certain app and/or website action shortcuts, the Bookmarks Software may need to
access certain third party software applications, services or websites on your Device. You expressly
consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for
some features of the Bookmarks Software and Services.
(i) Use of the App Store requires a unique user name and password combination, known as an Bookmarks ID.
An Bookmarks ID is also required to access app updates and certain features of the Bookmarks Software and
Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to
another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your Device, provided that: (a) the transfer
must include your Device and all of the Bookmarks Software, including all its component parts and this
License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on
a computer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the Bookmarks Software reads and agrees to

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

5. Services and Third Party Materials.
(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared
Albums” and “Find My” may be accessed directly from the Bookmarks Software. You acknowledge and agree
that your use of iCloud and these features is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the iCloud
service, which you may access and review at: https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/.
(c) News App Content. Your use of content accessed through the News application is limited solely to
personal, noncommercial use, does not transfer any ownership interest to you in the content, and
specifically excludes, without limitation, any commercial or promotional use rights in such content.

may vary by region. When you turn on or use Maps, details will be provided regarding what information
is sent to Bookmarks and how the information may be used. You acknowledge and agree that your use of
Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Bookmarks
Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

THIRD PARTY. YOUR USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.

cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for

(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the

your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

5. Services and Third Party Materials.
(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared
Albums” and “Find My” may be accessed directly from the Bookmarks Software. You acknowledge and agree
that your use of iCloud and these features is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the iCloud
service, which you may access and review at: https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/.

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should

information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you

their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not

sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit

Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all

appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or

sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening

Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all

appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to

(c) To the extent that Bookmarks has preinstalled Bookmarks-branded apps from the App Store on your Device at
the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable
law or by licensing terms governing use of open-source components that may be included with the
Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.
(e) The Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials so long as such use is limited to
reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you
are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from
republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any
rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.

or created with the Bookmarks Software (“System Characters”) (1) while running the Bookmarks Software and (2) to
create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

access certain third party software applications, services or websites on your Device. You expressly
consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for

(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to
another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your Device, provided that: (a) the transfer
must include your Device and all of the Bookmarks Software, including all its component parts and this
License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate
automatically or otherwise cease to be effective without notice from Bookmarks if you fail to comply with any
term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Bookmarks
Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

make the Bookmarks Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple Devices at the
same time. This License does not grant you any rights to use Bookmarks proprietary interfaces and other

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable
law or by licensing terms governing use of open-source components that may be included with the
Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.
(e) The Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials so long as such use is limited to
reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you
are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from
republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any
rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.

or created with the Bookmarks Software (“System Characters”) (1) while running the Bookmarks Software and (2) to
create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

access certain third party software applications, services or websites on your Device. You expressly
consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for

An Bookmarks ID is also required to access app updates and certain features of the Bookmarks Software and
Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE WILL BE

OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Bookmarks OR AN Bookmarks
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL Bookmarks, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR PRINCIPALS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA,
FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION COURSE

Bookmarks HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no
event shall Bookmarks’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law
in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars (U.S.$250.00). The
foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

certificates either issued from Bookmarks or from third parties. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR
DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY ON A CERTIFICATE WHETHER ISSUED BY Bookmarks OR A
THIRD PARTY. YOUR USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Bookmarks MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL CERTIFICATES.
10. Export Control. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Bookmarks Software except as
authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which the Bookmarks Software was

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable

Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.

republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be

and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.

offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Bookmarks OR AN Bookmarks
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL Bookmarks, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR PRINCIPALS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA,

DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY ON A CERTIFICATE WHETHER ISSUED BY Bookmarks OR A
THIRD PARTY. YOUR USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Bookmarks MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL CERTIFICATES.

C. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the Bookmarks
Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other
intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing
such content. This License does not grant you any rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that
such content will continue to be available to you.
2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
A. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License:
(i) Unless you obtained the Bookmarks Software as described in Section 2A(ii) below, you are granted a
limited, non-exclusive license to download, install and use one (1) copy of the Bookmarks Software on each
compatible computer you own or control;
(ii) If you obtained the Bookmarks Software from the Microsoft Store, you are granted a limited, nontransferable, non-exclusive license to download, install, and use one (1) copy of the Bookmarks Software on
each compatible computer that is affiliated with the Microsoft account that you use to access the Microsoft
Store.
B. Other Use Restrictions. To the extent that the Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials,
such use is limited to reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the
copyright, or materials you are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. You may not make the Bookmarks
Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time. You
may make one copy of the Bookmarks Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided
that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. In
addition to the restrictions stated above, the Bookmarks proprietary libraries (“Bookmarks DLLs”) included with the
Bookmarks Software are only licensed for use with the Bookmarks Software, except that if you are a WebKit
developer, you may use the Bookmarks DLLs for your personal use or internal business use in connection with
your development of WebKit in accordance with the relevant WebKit licenses <https://webkit.org/>.

be included with the Bookmarks Software).
D. VoiceOver Kit - Automatic Updates. When you are using VoiceOver Kit, the Bookmarks Software will
periodically check with Bookmarks for updates to the pronunciation rules used by VoiceOver to generate the
spoken items that you hear when you have VoiceOver selected. If a pronunciation update is available, the
update will automatically download onto your computer, and when you have VoiceOver selected, the new
version of the spoken items will be generated and synced to your iPod. The older version of the spoken
items will no longer be available. These automatic updates will not change the actual media content (e.g.,
music, video, podcasts) on your iPod or in your iTunes library.

included with the Bookmarks Software, have been or may be made available by Bookmarks on its Open Source web

is used, in place of the unmodified Bookmarks Software, on a single computer; and (ii) you otherwise comply

one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to another party, provided
that: (a) the transfer must include all of the Bookmarks Software, including all its component parts and this

about your computer, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to
provide and improve Bookmarks’s products and services, facilitate the provision of software updates, product

terms of this License. Bookmarks may use this information, as long as it is collected in a form that does not

certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms of service and may

B. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, iTunes Store account or iCloud account, you

E. To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you own
all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and that such
content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the Services,
including but not limited to graphics, audio clips, and editorial content, contain proprietary content,
information and material that is owned by Bookmarks and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable
intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use
such proprietary content, information or materials other than for permitted use of the Services or in any
manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property rights
of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You
agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in
any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not
limited to, using the Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or
by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to
harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and
that Bookmarks is not in any way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening,
defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of
using any of the Services.
F. In addition, Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on or linked to
from the Bookmarks Software are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no
representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any
particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such Services and Third Party Materials,
you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but
not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and data collection laws. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve
the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no
event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also
impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.

access certain third party software applications, services or websites on your Device. You expressly
consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for
some features of the Bookmarks Software and Services.
(i) Use of the App Store requires a unique user name and password combination, known as an Bookmarks ID.
An Bookmarks ID is also required to access app updates and certain features of the Bookmarks Software and
Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to
another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your Device, provided that: (a) the transfer

License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

5. Services and Third Party Materials.
(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared
Albums” and “Find My” may be accessed directly from the Bookmarks Software. You acknowledge and agree
that your use of iCloud and these features is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the iCloud
service, which you may access and review at: https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/.

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Bookmarks
Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

(c) To the extent that Bookmarks has preinstalled Bookmarks-branded apps from the App Store on your Device at
the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software

cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared

language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all

appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable
law or by licensing terms governing use of open-source components that may be included with the
Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.
(e) The Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials so long as such use is limited to
reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you
are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from
republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any
rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.

create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be

and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to
another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your Device, provided that: (a) the transfer
must include your Device and all of the Bookmarks Software, including all its component parts and this
License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

Bookmarks Software to exist on more than one Bookmarks-branded Device at a time, and you may not distribute or
make the Bookmarks Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple Devices at the
same time. This License does not grant you any rights to use Bookmarks proprietary interfaces and other
intellectual property in the design, development, manufacture, licensing or distribution of third party

notices contained on the original.
(c) To the extent that Bookmarks has preinstalled Bookmarks-branded apps from the App Store on your Device at
the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable
law or by licensing terms governing use of open-source components that may be included with the
Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.
(e) The Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials so long as such use is limited to
reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you
are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from
republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any
rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.

or created with the Bookmarks Software (“System Characters”) (1) while running the Bookmarks Software and (2) to
create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

access certain third party software applications, services or websites on your Device. You expressly
consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for

An Bookmarks ID is also required to access app updates and certain features of the Bookmarks Software and
Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to
another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your Device, provided that: (a) the transfer
must include your Device and all of the Bookmarks Software, including all its component parts and this
License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

5. Services and Third Party Materials.
(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Bookmarks
Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE WILL BE

OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Bookmarks OR AN Bookmarks
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL Bookmarks, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR PRINCIPALS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA,
FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION COURSE

OR SERVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED,

Bookmarks HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no
event shall Bookmarks’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law
in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars (U.S.$250.00). The
foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

certificates either issued from Bookmarks or from third parties. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR
DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY ON A CERTIFICATE WHETHER ISSUED BY Bookmarks OR A
THIRD PARTY. YOUR USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Bookmarks MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL CERTIFICATES.
10. Export Control. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Bookmarks Software except as

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App

the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable

republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be

and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.

offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Bookmarks OR AN Bookmarks
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL Bookmarks, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR PRINCIPALS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA,

THIRD PARTY. YOUR USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Bookmarks MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL CERTIFICATES.

in which case the terms of that license will govern.
C. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the Bookmarks
Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other
intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing
such content. This License does not grant you any rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that
such content will continue to be available to you.
2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
A. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License:
(i) Unless you obtained the Bookmarks Software as described in Section 2A(ii) below, you are granted a
limited, non-exclusive license to download, install and use one (1) copy of the Bookmarks Software on each
compatible computer you own or control;
(ii) If you obtained the Bookmarks Software from the Microsoft Store, you are granted a limited, nontransferable, non-exclusive license to download, install, and use one (1) copy of the Bookmarks Software on
each compatible computer that is affiliated with the Microsoft account that you use to access the Microsoft
Store.
B. Other Use Restrictions. To the extent that the Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials,
such use is limited to reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the
copyright, or materials you are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. You may not make the Bookmarks
Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time. You
may make one copy of the Bookmarks Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided
that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. In
addition to the restrictions stated above, the Bookmarks proprietary libraries (“Bookmarks DLLs”) included with the
Bookmarks Software are only licensed for use with the Bookmarks Software, except that if you are a WebKit
developer, you may use the Bookmarks DLLs for your personal use or internal business use in connection with
your development of WebKit in accordance with the relevant WebKit licenses <https://webkit.org/>.
C. No Reverse Engineering. You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as

prohibited by applicable law or by licensing terms governing use of Open-Sourced Components that may
be included with the Bookmarks Software).
D. VoiceOver Kit - Automatic Updates. When you are using VoiceOver Kit, the Bookmarks Software will
periodically check with Bookmarks for updates to the pronunciation rules used by VoiceOver to generate the
spoken items that you hear when you have VoiceOver selected. If a pronunciation update is available, the
update will automatically download onto your computer, and when you have VoiceOver selected, the new
version of the spoken items will be generated and synced to your iPod. The older version of the spoken
items will no longer be available. These automatic updates will not change the actual media content (e.g.,
music, video, podcasts) on your iPod or in your iTunes library.
E. Open Source. Certain components of the Bookmarks Software, and third party open source programs
included with the Bookmarks Software, have been or may be made available by Bookmarks on its Open Source web
site (https://www.opensource.Bookmarks.com/) (collectively the “Open-Sourced Components”). You may modify
or replace only these Open-Sourced Components; provided that: (i) the resultant modified Bookmarks Software
is used, in place of the unmodified Bookmarks Software, on a single computer; and (ii) you otherwise comply
with the terms of this License and any applicable licensing terms governing use of the Open-Sourced
Components. Bookmarks is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the

one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to another party, provided
that: (a) the transfer must include all of the Bookmarks Software, including all its component parts and this

about your computer, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to
provide and improve Bookmarks’s products and services, facilitate the provision of software updates, product
support and other services to you (if any) related to the Bookmarks Software, and to verify compliance with the
terms of this License. Bookmarks may use this information, as long as it is collected in a form that does not

certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms of service and may
be subject to additional fees.
B. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, iTunes Store account or iCloud account, you
agree to the applicable terms and conditions for that account, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services

accuracy.
D. Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By

the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any other

responsible for any such use by you.
E. To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you own
all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and that such
content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the Services,
including but not limited to graphics, audio clips, and editorial content, contain proprietary content,
information and material that is owned by Bookmarks and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable
intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use
such proprietary content, information or materials other than for permitted use of the Services or in any
manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property rights
of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You
agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in
any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not
limited to, using the Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or
by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to
harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and
that Bookmarks is not in any way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening,
defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of
using any of the Services.
F. In addition, Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on or linked to
from the Bookmarks Software are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no
representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any
particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such Services and Third Party Materials,
you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but
not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and data collection laws. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve
the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no
event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also
impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for
some features of the Bookmarks Software and Services.
(i) Use of the App Store requires a unique user name and password combination, known as an Bookmarks ID.
An Bookmarks ID is also required to access app updates and certain features of the Bookmarks Software and
Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.
3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Bookmarks Software. You may,
however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

5. Services and Third Party Materials.
(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared
Albums” and “Find My” may be accessed directly from the Bookmarks Software. You acknowledge and agree
that your use of iCloud and these features is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the iCloud
service, which you may access and review at: https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/.

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these

a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.

cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for

install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.

sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared

offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to

a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App

the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable

through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by

Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or

Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should

information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data

information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,

posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable
law or by licensing terms governing use of open-source components that may be included with the
Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.
(e) The Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials so long as such use is limited to
reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you
are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from
republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any
rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.

create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for

Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to
another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your Device, provided that: (a) the transfer

License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

when using various communication features of the Bookmarks Software, such as iMessage and FaceTime.
When you use iMessage, Bookmarks may hold your messages in encrypted form for a limited period of time in
order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.
6. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate

Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Bookmarks OR AN Bookmarks
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA,

Bookmarks HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF

make the Bookmarks Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple Devices at the
same time. This License does not grant you any rights to use Bookmarks proprietary interfaces and other

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable
law or by licensing terms governing use of open-source components that may be included with the
Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.
(e) The Bookmarks Software may be used to reproduce materials so long as such use is limited to
reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you
are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from
republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any

create your own original content and projects for your personal, non-commercial use; and (ii) use the
Live Captions automatically generated on-device in real time by the Bookmarks Software (“Live Captions”),
whether generated during a FaceTime call or otherwise, only for your personal, non-commercial use. No

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be

An Bookmarks ID is also required to access app updates and certain features of the Bookmarks Software and
Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.

example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.

judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE WILL BE

OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Bookmarks OR AN Bookmarks
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

SHALL Bookmarks, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR PRINCIPALS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA,

Bookmarks HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no
event shall Bookmarks’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law
in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars (U.S.$250.00). The
foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY ON A CERTIFICATE WHETHER ISSUED BY Bookmarks OR A
THIRD PARTY. YOUR USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Bookmarks MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL CERTIFICATES.

the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these
Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your Device. When you associate
a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating
all other Preinstalled Apps on your Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App
Store account, you agree that Bookmarks may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Bookmarks ID
used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your Device, as unique
account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to
the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store. If you do not wish to use a Preinstalled App, you can delete
it from your Device at any time.
(d) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this
License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt,
modify, or create derivative works of the Bookmarks Software or any services provided by the Bookmarks Software
or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable

Bookmarks Software). You agree not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices (including trademark
and copyright notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the Bookmarks Software.

republishing, retransmitting or reproducing any images accessed through News or Maps as a standalone file. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by, stored on or accessed
through your Device belong to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by
copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
party providing such content. Except as otherwise provided herein, this License does not grant you any

limited to the use, reproduction, display, performance, recording, publishing or redistribution of any of
the System Characters or Live Captions in a profit, non-profit, public sharing or commercial context.

consent to such use to the extent necessary to complete the Shortcut with the Bookmarks Software.
(h) You agree to use the Bookmarks Software and the Services (as defined in Section 5 below) in compliance
with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you
download or use the Bookmarks Software and Services. Features of the Bookmarks Software and the Services may
not be available in all languages or regions, some features may vary by region, and some may be
restricted or unavailable from your service provider. A Wi-Fi or cellular data connection is required for

Services.
(j) You acknowledge that many features, built-in apps, and Services of the Bookmarks Software transmit data
and could impact charges to your data plan, and that you are responsible for any such charges. You can
view and control which applications are permitted to use cellular data and view an estimate of how much
data such applications have consumed under Cellular Data Settings. In addition, Wi-Fi Assist will
automatically switch to cellular when you have a poor Wi-Fi connection, which might result in more
cellular data use and impact charges to your data plan. Wi-Fi Assist is on by default, but can be
disabled under Settings. For more information, please consult the User Guide for your Device.
(k) If you choose to allow automatic app updates, your Device will periodically check with Bookmarks for
updates to the apps on your Device and, if one is available, the update will automatically download and
install onto your Device. You can turn off the automatic app updates altogether at any time by going to
Settings, tap iTunes & App Store, and under Automatic Downloads, turn off Updates.
(l) Using your Device in some circumstances can distract you and may cause a dangerous situation (for
example, avoid typing a text message while driving a car or using headphones while riding a bicycle). By
using your Device you agree that you are responsible for observing rules that prohibit or restrict the use
of mobile phones or headphones (for example, the requirement to use hands-free options for making
calls when driving).
(m) Certain features of the Bookmarks Software may attempt to provide assistance in safety-related situations,
such as any safety-related detection feature and connecting you to emergency services (as available).
Bookmarks does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of such
features. These features are not intended to be solely relied upon in situations where more
immediate or effective help is available and may be obtained. You agree to use these features at your
sole risk and exercise independent judgment, and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, or principals shall
have no liability to you for your use of these features and any resulting consequences to the maximum
extent permitted by law.
(n) Your Device is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical
judgment. It is not designed or intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease. Please consult your healthcare
provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Bookmarks Software to

License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Bookmarks Software, full or partial, including copies stored on

order to ensure their delivery. You may turn off FaceTime or iMessage by going to the FaceTime or
Messages settings on your Device. Certain features like Analytics, Location Services, Siri, and Dictation
may require information from your Device to provide their respective functions. When you turn on or use
these features, details will be provided regarding what information is sent to Bookmarks and how the
information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https://www.Bookmarks.com/privacy/. At all times
your information will be treated in accordance with Bookmarks’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at:

(a) The Bookmarks Software may enable access to Bookmarks’s iTunes Store, App Store, Bookmarks Books, Game
Center, iCloud, Maps, News, Fitness+ and other Bookmarks and third party services and web sites
(collectively and individually, “Services”). Use of these Services requires Internet access and use of
certain Services may require an Bookmarks ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
subject to additional fees. By using this software in connection with an Bookmarks ID, or other Bookmarks
Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Bookmarks Media Services Terms
and Conditions for the country or region in which you access such Services, which you may access and
review at https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.
(b) If you sign up for iCloud, certain iCloud features like “iCloud Drive”, “My Photo Stream”, “Shared
Albums” and “Find My” may be accessed directly from the Bookmarks Software. You acknowledge and agree
that your use of iCloud and these features is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the iCloud
service, which you may access and review at: https://www.Bookmarks.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/.

Maps is subject to the latest terms and conditions of the Maps service, which you may access and
review on the Maps home card.
(e) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed
offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit
language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and
unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the
Services at your sole risk and that Bookmarks, its affiliates, agents, principals, or licensors shall have no
liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
(f) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Bookmarks is not responsible for examining or evaluating
the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality
or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Bookmarks, its officers, affiliates and
subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
are provided solely as a convenience to you.
(g) Neither Bookmarks nor any of its content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness,
reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any Services.
Financial information displayed by any Services is for general informational purposes only and should
not be relied upon as investment advice. Before executing any securities transaction based upon
information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional
who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data
provided by any Services, including the Bookmarks Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and
planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location
information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may
lead to death, personal injury, or property or environmental damage. You agree that the results you
receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can
affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions,
and geopolitical events. For your safety when using the navigation feature, always pay attention to
posted road signs and current road conditions. Follow safe driving practices and traffic regulations, and
note that cycling and walking directions may not include designated pathways.
(h) To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that you
own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Bookmarks, the site owner or
their licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not
limited to copyright. You agree that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials
other than for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this
License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Bookmarks. No portion of the
Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan,
sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit
the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to
transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening
network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk,
threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that Bookmarks is not in any
way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive,
infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the
Services.
(i) In addition, such Services and Third Party Materials may not be available in all languages or in all
countries or regions. Bookmarks makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are
appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access
such Services or Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and
data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your Device may cause metadata, including
where and when the photo was taken, and depth information, to be transmitted with the photos. Use of
Bookmarks services (such as iCloud Photo Library) to share or sync such photos will involve Bookmarks receiving
and storing such metadata. Bookmarks and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or
disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Bookmarks be liable for the removal
of or disabling of access to any such Services. Bookmarks may also impose limits on the use of or access to
certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.

OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.
7.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY Bookmarks OR AN Bookmarks
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE Bookmarks SOFTWARE OR
SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE
ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
SHALL Bookmarks, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR PRINCIPALS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR
ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA,

THIRD PARTY. YOUR USE OF DIGITAL CERTIFICATES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Bookmarks MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SECURITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS
WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL CERTIFICATES.
